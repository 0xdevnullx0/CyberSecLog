# /*Secrecy*/
>>> Secrecy is binary, it is all or nothing. If there is secrecy for 99 transactions and then a failure on the 100th. The previous 99 are all compromised as well.

# /*Evasion*/
>>> Successful evasion doesn't carry forward to the future (although failures do), and failures propagate back to the past

# /*Defense in Depth*/
>>>Defense in depth against configuration errors is just as important as defense in depth from attacks
