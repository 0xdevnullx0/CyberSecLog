# /*Secrecy*/
>>> Secrecy is binary, it is all or nothing. If there is secrecy for 99 transactions and then a failure on the 100th. The previous 99 are all compromised as well.

# /*Evasion*/
>>> Successful evasion doesn't carry forward to the future (although failures do), and failures propagate back to the past

# /*Defense in Depth*/
>>>Defense in depth against configuration errors is just as important as defense in depth from attacks

# /*Detecting Known Unknowns*/
>>>You can't detect what you don't know about and if you don't know about an entire class of assets inside of your infrastructure you won't get any detection around those assets and they become a perfect entry point for an attacker

# /*Attacker*/
>>>Your attackers have budgets, meetings, deliverables, and deadlines too
